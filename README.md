# Email Spam Detection 
This project implements an Email Spam Detection system using Machine Learning techniques to classify emails as spam or non-spam. It demonstrates how machine learning models can be applied to real-world problems, specifically in natural language processing (NLP) for text classification.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as spam or not. The dataset used contains a variety of spam and non-spam email samples. The system uses feature extraction techniques from text data and applies several classification models to identify spam emails.

## Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed raw email text for better model performance.<br>
Feature Extraction: Used techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features.<br>
Model Training: Implemented machine learning algorithm Logistic Regression<br>
Model Evaluation: Evaluated models based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
Python<br>
Scikit-learn<br>
Pandas<br>
Numpy<br>
Matplotlib<br>
Seaborn<br>
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
